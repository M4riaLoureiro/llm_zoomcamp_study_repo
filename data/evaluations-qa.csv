RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing a solution (creating a personal access token) to the issue of password authentication no longer being supported on GitHub. It also offers a resource for more detailed information, making it fully relevant to the user's query."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing a resource for instructions to install TensorFlow GPU on Ubuntu and includes important considerations about installing CUDA and cuDNN, which are essential for GPU support."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by explaining the role of `y_true` in the calculation of the AUC score with sklearn. It specifies that `y_true` represents the actual target values and is used alongside `y_score` to compute the AUC, which is exactly what the question seeks to understand."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by explaining how Quinn Avila resolved the issue of a Jupyter notebook not recognizing a newly installed package. It specifies the action taken (restarting the notebook) and the command used to install the package ('pip install pillow'), providing a clear and relevant solution to the problem posed in the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the modification made to the median_house_value target, specifying that it was changed to binary format. It explains the reasoning behind the change, highlighting the transition from a continuous variable to a discrete one for the purpose of calculating mutual information, which is pertinent to the question."
